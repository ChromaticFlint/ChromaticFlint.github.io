A simple game about scrolling through new article obstacles while running from responsibility. The goal of this game was to create a game from scratch going through all the phases of planning, design, development, testing, and publishing. I had a lot of fun learning more about Unity, game development, and the some of the nuances mobile development throughout this project. I hope you enjoy it!
